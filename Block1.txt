Sometimes I just wish I could go back to childhood. Those days felt more alive, more real, than anything I feel now. Nostalgia hits me so hard that I don’t know what to do with it. I can’t fully live in those sweet memories, but I also struggle to move forward and create new ones. It leaves me in this strange space—comforting in some way, but also making me feel a little childish.But then again, maybe it doesn’t matter. Everyone’s just running their own race, getting tired, falling asleep, waking up, and doing it all over again. In my story, I’m everything at once—the hero, the boss, the villain, and whoever else I need to be. At the end of the day, I’m just doing things for myself. And even if it feels weird sometimes, I’d rather be real than pretend to be someone I’m not.But then again, maybe it doesn’t matter.
