But then again, maybe it doesn’t matter. Everyone’s just running their own race, getting tired, falling asleep, waking up, and doing it all over again. In my story, I’m everything at once—the hero, the boss, the villain, and whoever else I need to be. At the end of the day, I’m just doing things for myself. And even if it feels weird sometimes, I’d rather be real than pretend to be someone I’m not.
